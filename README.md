## How do I install the module / Components?
1. Download the module / Components and move/copy the folder to "C:\ProgramData\PowerShellUniversal\Dashboard\Components"
2. Restart the Powershelluniversal services in Task Manager.
3. Enter the Admin console for Powershell universal and add this component to your dashboard
4. Don't know if this is necessary but I use to restart the PowerShell Universal service once again.
